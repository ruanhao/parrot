  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "Sending back soup" is a cultural allusion that refers to a person sending back bad food that he or she received in a restaurant.
    There is an old joke that goes like this: The diner says to the waiter, "What is that fly doing in my soup?" The waiter responds,
    "The backstroke." In other words, the person saw an insect in the soup, pointed it out to the server,
    who did not seem to care but instead made a sarcastic remark.
    In the TV series Friends, a person who couldn't send back soup is a person who is too shy to stand up for him or herself.
