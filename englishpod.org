     Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what's happening?

     The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop!
     We're there to show the government that we don't like the way that
     they're spending our tax dollars!

  A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

     dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.
     These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

  A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that
     it could help save the jobs of millions of hard-working Americans.

  B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job,
     but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?
     And then, they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets!
     This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars!
     And they're asking for money! That is just not right!

     This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C., back to you, Tom.

  A: Dad, I'd like to borrow some money.

  B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks?

  A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market.
     You know, I'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn,
     the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses.
     I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start
     on building my nest egg.

  B: I don't know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now,
     it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if you're aware son,
     but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.
     There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months,
     and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon our economy.
     There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

  A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity.
     And anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market.
     There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example;
     they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class.
     Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents
     an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

  B: Come on, son, you're looking at this too naively, the Chinese market
     has exhibited a great deal of instability,
     and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

  A: Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it.
     But you're losing out on a great opportunity here.
     I'm going to go hit up Mum for the cash.

  - production lead time

  - On any given day about forty million people use the Internet.
  - Firefighters have to be ready to attend an emergency at any given moment.
- I'm with you on this one (I agree with you)
- carrying cost (the cost of holding inventory)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  A: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.
     As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis,
     we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.
     We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies.
     So, we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.

  B: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

  C: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

  B: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.

  A: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together,
     reducing queue length, like for example,
     reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine,
     and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.
     Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers,
     possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or
     working with a faster shipping company.

  C: I see... That makes sense.

  B: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and
     implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that
     lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated.
     A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers
     the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to
     stop production when something goes wrong.

  C: I'm with you on this one. It's essential that we reduce these errors;
     we've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

  A: Exactly. Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration,
  with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology.
  I chose this course of study for two reasons:
  I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided,
  and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success,
  hence the minor in psychology.

  I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master's in that area.
  I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.

  When I was in Oracle, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care, and process management.
  I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.
  In this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.
  With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.
